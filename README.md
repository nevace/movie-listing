# Movie Listings Challenge

I've set this project up in a similar way to how I'd set up a react project from scratch. I have the linting/code style 
rules in my IDE and would usually add a precommit hook with prettier to format everything consistently.

I haven't used redux, mobX etc. for state management due to the simple nature of this project. The extra 
boilerplate would be overkill but I'm happy to add that in if that's what was expected. Usually, the api related code 
would be in that area. 

I've written a few tests to give an example of library usage and setup and have commented where I think it would be 
helpful.

### Installing

After cloning the project, install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

And then run the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests

```
npm test
```
